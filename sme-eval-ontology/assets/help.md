## Using the Interactive Ontology Viewer

The interactive viewer is crucial for understanding the ontology structure. It offers three visualization modes:

### **Tree View**
- Hierarchical, expandable structure
- Click nodes to expand/collapse branches
- Good for understanding parent-child relationships

### **Graph View**
- Network-style visualization showing connections
- Drag nodes to rearrange layout
- Useful for seeing cross-relationships

### **Sunburst View**
- Circular, nested visualization
- Each ring represents a hierarchy level
- Compact overview of the entire structure

### **Tips for Using the Viewer:**
- **Click on any node** to see detailed reasoning and examples
- **Switch between views** to get different perspectives
- **Take your time exploring** before answering questions
- **Zoom and pan** if needed for better visibility
