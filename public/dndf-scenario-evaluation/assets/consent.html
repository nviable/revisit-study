    <h1>Evaluating AI-Generated Scenarios for Journalistic Verification Training</h1>

    <h2>Investigator Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Principal Investigator</strong><br>
            Saniat Javid Sohrawardi, PhD Candidate, Rochester Institute of Technology.</li>
        <li><strong>Faculty Advisors:</strong><br>
            Dr. Matthew Wright, Rochester Institute of Technology.<br>
            Dr. Andrea Hickerson, University of Mississippi.</li>
        <li><strong>Collaborators:</strong><br>
            Y. Kelly Wu, Rochester Institute of Technology.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Purpose of the Research</h2>
    <p>You are being invited to participate in a research study to help us evaluate the quality and effectiveness of AI-generated journalistic training scenarios for journalists. The purpose of this study is to assess the scenarios created by an AI system (AMaGen) for the purpose of simulating plausible investigation situations. Your feedback will inform the development of better training tools to help journalists combat media manipulation.</p>

    <h2>What You Will Be Asked to Do</h2>
    <p>If you agree to participate, you will be asked to complete an online survey. The study consists of two main parts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Part A: Scenario Evaluation:</strong> You will be presented with 3 short training scenarios. For each scenario, you will be asked to rate its quality and suitability for training using a series of scale-based and open-ended questions.</li>
        <li><strong>Part B: Background Information:</strong> You will be asked three short questions regarding your experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Time Commitment</h2>
    <p>Your participation in this study is expected to take approximately <strong>30-45 minutes</strong> to complete.</p>

    <h2>Risks and Benefits</h2>
    <p><strong>Risks:</strong> The main risk is the possibility of minor mental fatigue, as the survey is detailed and requires concentration. You are encouraged to take breaks as needed. There are no other anticipated risks to you for participating in this study.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> The direct benefit to you is the opportunity to engage with and reflect on novel AI-driven training methodologies. The broader benefit is your contribution to research aimed at improving journalism education and practice.</p>

    <h2>Compensation</h2>
    <p>Upon completion of the study, you will receive a <strong>$25 gift card</strong> in appreciation for your time and contribution. If you withdraw before completing the study, you will receive partial compensation based on the portion completed.</p>

    <h2>Confidentiality and Data Handling</h2>
    <p>Your privacy is a top priority. The data collected in this study will be used for research purposes only.</p>
    
    <p><strong>What Data is Collected:</strong> We will collect your answers to survey questions, which include your ratings, provided demographics and written feedback on the training scenarios and AI-generated text.</p>
    
    <p><strong>How Privacy is Protected:</strong> All data will be <strong>anonymized</strong>, meaning any information that could identify you will be removed. All research data will be stored securely on password-protected university servers accessible only to the research team.</p>

    <h2>Voluntary Participation</h2>
    <p>Your participation in this study is completely <strong>voluntary</strong>. You may choose not to participate at all, or you may refuse to answer certain questions or stop participating at any time.</p>

    <h2>Contact Information</h2>
    <p>You are encouraged to contact us with any questions or concerns that you might have, even after leaving this survey. Furthermore, we will gladly provide you with an in-person debriefing regarding this form, the program or the research if you desire.</p>
