    "scenario_title": "County Health Meeting Leak",
    "scenario_summary": "In a rural Midwestern county, a short video clip surfaces on local message boards and is quickly amplified by an online conspiracy network claiming it proves preferential vaccine distribution and cover-ups during the pandemic. The clip shows the county health director speaking in a visibly emotional tone during what appears to be an internal meeting; viewers interpret fragments of the remarks as an admission of misconduct. Your newsroom is asked to verify the clip amid low local journalistic freedom and rising community anxiety about vaccine access. The clip is authentic footage recorded from a closed staff meeting but was leaked without context and cropped to emphasize a handful of lines. There is no deepfake or technical audio manipulation — the subject’s micro-expressions and affect are genuine — but the excerpt omits surrounding clarifications that explain operational prioritization decisions and logistical constraints. A sophisticated conspiracy network with technical reach amplifies the clip to maximize distrust, while county officials are wary of releasing internal records. The realistic training challenge is to (1) treat the source with skeptical empathy, asking for original files and corroboration; (2) analyze metadata and meeting logs where available; (3) geolocate and timestamp the recording; and (4) contextualize the remarks by contacting attendees and reviewing scheduling documents. The scenario gives trainees chances to practice source handling, EXIF/metadata checks, the 5 Ws, and out-of-context verification under time pressure and constrained access.",

Zoom/meeting UI is visible in the corner; a few other participants are partially visible off-camera. The audio contains phrases about prioritization and limited vaccine supply; several sentences are cut off mid-thought. No overlays or captions are present in the file you were sent.",
