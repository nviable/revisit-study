## Thank You

Thank you for your time and expertise! Your answer will help us build a more accurate and standardized Digital Visual Media Forensics ontology for the community.

**Interested in a short follow-up conversation?**

We would love to have a short follow-up 30-minute video call (Zoom or Google Meet) with participants who would like to talk through the answers they provided and share deeper perspectives. If you're interested, please book a slot through this link.

If you have any questions regarding this Ontology project or our work broadly, please do not hesitate to contact us.
