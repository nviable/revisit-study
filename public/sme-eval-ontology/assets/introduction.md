## Introduction

Thank you for lending your expertise to evaluate this Digital Visual Media Forensics (DVM-F) ontology. This ontology aims to create a standardized, hierarchical structure of terminologies used across the DVM-F field, based on an analysis of academic literature and guidance from standardization bodies. The ontology consists of four branches capturing the analytics' targeted modalities, the type of manipulations analytics detect or tasks they complete, the features used by the analytics, and the analysis scope. Your feedback is invaluable for refining its structure, ensuring its completeness and correctness, and assessing its potential utility for researchers, practitioners, and analysts.

**Instructions:** The survey has **five sections**, starting from gathering some basic demographic information about your expertise, and moving into assessing the completeness and correctness of the proposed ontology from high-level to detailed branch-by-branch view. Please have the interactive ontology viewer open for reference as you proceed. And, the survey will wrap up with an evaluation on how to view the ontology and its application potential. The survey should take approximately 25-35 minutes.
