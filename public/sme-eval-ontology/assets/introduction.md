## Introduction

Thank you for lending your expertise to evaluate this Digital Visual Media Forensics (DVM-F) ontology. This ontology aims to create a standardized, hierarchical structure of terminologies used across the DVM-F field, based on an analysis of academic literature and guidance from standardization bodies. The ontology consists of four branches capturing the analytics' targeted modalities, the type of manipulations analytics detect or tasks they complete, the features used by the analytics, and the analysis scope. Your feedback is invaluable for refining its structure, ensuring its completeness and correctness, and assessing its potential utility for researchers, practitioners, and analysts.

Even small points of confusion or disagreement are helpful. Please approach this as a structured reviewâ€”**flag anything that seems unclear, misplaced, or potentially misleading**, even if you're not entirely certain. Your critical insights will directly shape the next version.

**Instructions:** The survey starts from gathering some basic demographic information about your expertise, and moves into assessing the proposed ontology from high-level to detailed branch-by-branch view. The survey will wrap up with an evaluation on the interactive viewer that we use to present the ontology and its application potential. We expect the survey to take 45-60 minutes.

**Progress Saving:** Your responses are automatically saved as you move through the survey. You can close the survey and return at any time to continue where you left off.
