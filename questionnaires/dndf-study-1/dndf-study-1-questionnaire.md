# Evaluation of AMaGen Scenarios

[main content step 1][sidebar empty]
Thank you for agreeing to participate in this study. You will be presented with three fictional, interactive news scenarios meant to help journalists practice information verification skills. Your task is to evaluate the **quality of the narrative** for this purpose. After evaluating the scenarios, you will be asked a few questions about your background.

**There are no right or wrong answers; we are interested in your honest feedback on the story itself.**  
---

In the following sections you will see three scenarios and will be asked questions to evaluate the scenarios.

### Part A: Scenario Evaluation
**Scenario Title:** Election Official Zoom Confession Goes Viral
**Role:** You are Alex Chen, a senior investigative journalist at 'The London Sentinel,' a reputable independent news outlet known for its rigorous fact-checking and political coverage.  
**Scenario:** May 3, 2024 | Three days before the London mayoral election, an anonymous post on a little-known political blog, 'TruthSeeker UK,' releases a video claiming to be a 'shocking confession' from incumbent Mayor Eleanor Vance. The blog post alleges the video proves Vance has been accepting illegal campaign donations, a claim that could derail her re-election.
**Video:** The video, approximately 90 seconds long, shows Mayor Eleanor Vance seated at a desk in what appears to be a private office, speaking directly to the camera. She is wearing a dark suit. Her facial expressions are somber, and her voice sounds strained as she articulates details about receiving undeclared funds from a property development firm for her campaign. The background includes a bookshelf and a framed photograph.  
**Initial Clues & Context:**
* Mayor Vance has recently faced scrutiny over her campaign's funding transparency, though no official charges have been made.  
* The property developer mentioned in the video, 'CityBuild Holdings,' has been involved in several controversial projects in London.  
* Social media is already abuzz with discussions both condemning and defending Mayor Vance, with \#VanceConfession trending.  
  **Stakes:** The outcome of the mayoral election hangs in the balance, and public trust in democratic processes could be severely damaged. Verifying the authenticity (or lack thereof) of this video is critical to prevent the spread of harmful disinformation and ensure fair electoral reporting.  
  *\[The below information is not visible to participants engaging with the scenario during the training simulation, however itâ€™s shown to you for better context\]*  
  **Ground Truth:** Video is Fake; Deepfake (Video and Audio Synthesis);   
  **True Motive:** To discredit Mayor Eleanor Vance and manipulate public opinion in the highly polarized London mayoral election, thereby influencing the outcome in favor of a rival candidate.
