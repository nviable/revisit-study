  "scenario_title": "Viral Clip Alters Celebrity Remarks",
  "scenario_summary": "A 45-second clip of a well-known actor and activist, Jordan Hale, circulated widely after being posted by a fringe account and picked up by partisan social feeds. The clip appears to show Hale at a regional charity town-hall making a dismissive, sarcastic remark about a community group, triggering outrage across partisan networks and calls for mainstream outlets to cover the apparent gaffe. Behind the scenes a medium-sophistication conspiracy network amplified the clip to inflame polarized audiences. The core footage is derived from an authentic local TV livestream, but adversaries applied targeted expression-manipulation and light splicing to alter Hale's micro-expressions in short segments, creating the impression of a smirk and an insincere tone at a key moment. The manipulation is partial: most of the clip is authentic broadcast footage, but two edits around the 00:16–00:22 window were altered. The forgers also performed minor audio edits that introduce subtle AV desynchronization. Raw station archives and an unedited full-length recording exist and, when compared frame-by-frame, show a different facial cadence and timing at the contested moment. The motive for the manipulation was to provoke outrage among highly polarized audiences and drive engagement for fringe channels, not to extort or monetize directly. The scenario gives trainees opportunities to practice OSINT source tracing, skeptical reading of automated detector output (which should be conflicted), frame-by-frame artifact spotting, and corroboration with primary-source raw footage and expert analysis.",

    "dm_summary": "The circulating 45s clip is built from authentic broadcast livestream footage but has been partially altered: expression-manipulation was applied to a 6–8 second close-up to change micro-expressions and add a subtle smirk; splicing inserted a slightly different mouth shape from nearby frames. Minor audio edits introduced slight AV desynchronization. Tells include jump cuts at splice boundaries, micro-expression timing mismatches, and a low-level audio-visual desync. Raw station archive contains the unedited 90-minute feed showing a different expression cadence at the contested timestamp.",
