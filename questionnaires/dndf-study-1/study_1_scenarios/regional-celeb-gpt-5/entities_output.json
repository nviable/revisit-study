    "description": "A high-profile actor known for vocal commentary on social issues and a charismatic on-screen persona; followed by an ideologically mixed audience. Frequently speaks at regional charity and community events and relies on a small team (publicist/legal) to manage press; unlikely to engage directly with unvetted inquiries about circulated clips.",
    "behavioral_notes_for_dm": "Will not provide private raw footage personally and will direct reporters to the publicist; expects outlets to seek verification before publishing and will likely issue a concise public statement through the PR team."

    "description": "Custodian of WKLM-TV's broadcast archives, including the unedited 90-minute town-hall feed that contains the contested segment; notes that frame 00:18:12 of the raw archive shows different micro-expression timing and a natural blink cadence that contradicts the viral clip. Responsible for metadata, timecodes, and official file transfers.",
    "behavioral_notes_for_dm": "Reluctant at first and asks for newsroom credentials and a short verification wait, but ultimately cooperative (will provide the unedited feed after verifying identity and email/assignment)."

    "description": "Operates a cluster of partisan channels, message boards, and social accounts that specialize in rapid amplification of inflammatory media; uses targeted reposting and coordinated captions to stoke outrage rather than to monetize directly. Known to splice authentic sources with altered segments to increase shareability.",
    "behavioral_notes_for_dm": "Posts provocative commentary and uses logical fallacies (whataboutism, straw man) in replies; refuses direct sourcing requests and will deflect or delete messages rather than hand over provenance."

The analyst provides a summary-level readout rather than raw models or internal thresholds.",
