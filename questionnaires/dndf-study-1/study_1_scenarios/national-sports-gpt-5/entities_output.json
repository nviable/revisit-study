    "description": "Marcus Vale is a high-profile athlete with a polished public persona and a long history of brand endorsements. He is negotiating with multiple streaming platforms and is sensitive to anything that could affect contract leverage or fan sentiment.",
    "behavioral_notes_for_dm": "Restrained and media-trained — prefers terse, controlled responses and will defer to his publicist; when confronted he is likely to express surprise and request that the outlet coordinate with his team before publishing."

    "description": "CSN is a high-profile sports broadcaster with a centralized archive system and strict on-air editing logs. Their editorial credibility is at stake because the clip appears to originate from one of their evening shows even though their archive shows a different audio track.",
    "behavioral_notes_for_dm": "Responsive but legally cautious — will confirm archive discrepancies and provide timecoded feeds to trusted outlets, but may delay public comment until legal and compliance review is complete."

    "description": "Silverline is a boutique PR and media operations firm known for aggressive digital campaigns and deep technical resources; internal traces suggest they executed a targeted, high-sophistication edit to seed favorable commentary for a client.",
    "behavioral_notes_for_dm": "Deniable and evasive — spokespeople will issue generic praise-of-client statements and attempt to shift blame, request takedowns or negotiations privately, and avoid admitting technical involvement."
