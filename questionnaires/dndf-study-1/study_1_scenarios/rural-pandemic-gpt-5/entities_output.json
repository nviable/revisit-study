    "name": "Sara Martinez",
    "role": "County Health Director overseeing vaccine distribution across a largely rural Midwestern county.",
    "description": "Mid-40s public health professional with a decade of experience in local health administration; known locally for blunt, direct communication and hands-on management of immunization clinics. In the leaked clip she appears emotional but coherent, conveying operational frustrations and the ethical weight of prioritization decisions.",
    "behavioral_notes_for_dm": "Responds guardedly to reporters — defensive about leaks and protective of staff — but will provide clarifying context if spoken to with empathy about pressures she faced; prefers email or scheduled calls and may ask that sensitive personnel matters be treated off the record."

    "description": "Mid-30s operations/data staffer with routine access to meeting recordings and chat logs; politically risk-averse and fearful of retaliation. Claims to have pulled the recording from an internal meeting folder and emailed an MP4 along with a partial participant list and chat excerpt.",
    "behavioral_notes_for_dm": "Provides the original file but is evasive about chain of custody and how they accessed it; responds slowly, insists on anonymity and requests careful handling to avoid exposing their identity."

    "description": "Experienced municipal communications professional who balances transparency with legal and privacy constraints; accustomed to media scrutiny but risk-averse when internal records are requested. Will confirm whether a meeting occurred and its general topic but resists releasing internal minutes or raw recordings without internal review.",
    "behavioral_notes_for_dm": "Reluctant to release internal records immediately and will cite policy and legal concerns; willing to confirm meeting date/time/topic and point to published materials but likely to route detailed record requests through formal channels or counsel."

    "description": "Small, highly active online group with strong social-media reach among regional audiences; uses rapid reposting, caption-driven narratives, and fringe forums to maximize distrust. The group has technical know-how to crop and re-encode clips for virality and coordinates messaging across platforms.",
    "behavioral_notes_for_dm": "Will repost and amplify without engaging with corrections or requests for context; if contacted publicly, they will deflect and double down on provocative claims rather than provide provenance."

    "description": "Late-20s consultant who runs metadata and video-forensics checks for local reporters and civic groups; comfortable extracting EXIF/MP4 metadata, timestamps and platform headers. Notes that automated detection tools can flag a clip as 'edited' when headers or UI elements are removed and compression artifacts vary, producing conflicting confidence scores.",
    "behavioral_notes_for_dm": "Cooperative and willing to analyze original MP4 and accompanying files, but will explain technical limitations plainly; likely to volunteer that a creation timestamp and platform metadata should be extractable from the supplied original file."

Has a practical memory of operational tradeoffs but not verbatim recollection of the director's remarks.",
    "behavioral_notes_for_dm": "Willing to speak but memory is fuzzy and recollections may conflict with others; emphasizes logistical constraints and will deny that the director was admitting intentional favoritism."

Familiar with the county's published prioritization policy and scheduling spreadsheets.",
    "behavioral_notes_for_dm": "Generally cooperative and willing to share her notes or point to public scheduling documents; cautious about releasing internal meeting minutes but will help contextualize the director's remarks."

Internally holds meeting recordings, chat logs and participant lists but typically treats those as restricted records.",
    "behavioral_notes_for_dm": "Official channels will point reporters to published schedules and press releases; internal records requests are handled formally and may be delayed or routed through counsel, though staff may privately confirm high-level facts about meetings."
