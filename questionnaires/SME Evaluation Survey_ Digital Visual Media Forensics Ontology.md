## **SME Evaluation Survey: Digital Visual Media Forensics Ontology**

### **Page 1**

### **Introduction**

Thank you for lending your expertise to evaluate this Digital Visual Media Forensics (DVM-F) ontology. This ontology aims to create a standardized, hierarchical structure of terminologies used across the DVM-F field, based on an analysis of academic literature and guidance from standardization bodies. The ontology consists of four branches capturing the analytics’ targeted modalities, the type of manipulations analytics detect or tasks they complete, the features used by the analytics, and the analysis scope. Your feedback is invaluable for refining its structure, ensuring its completeness and correctness, and assessing its potential utility for researchers, practitioners, and analysts.

Even small points of confusion or disagreement are helpful. Please approach this as a structured review—**flag anything that seems unclear, misplaced, or potentially misleading**, even if you're not entirely certain. Your critical insights will directly shape the next version.

**Instructions:** The survey has **five sections**, starting from gathering some basic demographic information about your expertise, and moving into assessing the completeness and correctness of the proposed ontology from high-level to detailed branch-by-branch view. A Link to access an interactive ontology viewer will be provided on appropriate pages. The survey will wrap up with an evaluation on how to view the ontology and its application potential. The survey should take 45-60 minutes.

Please proceed to the next page to view and complete the **Informed Consent Document** for this study.

### **Section 2: Overall Ontological Structure**

*This question assesses your high-level impression of the ontology's core framework. Please open the interactive viewer to browse the complete ontology.* 

*Link to the interactive viewer: \[Link\]*   
*You can browse the ontology in three different ways: 1\. Expandable Tree, 2\. Graph, and 3\. Sunburst Chart.*

2.1. The ontology is divided into four main branches: (1) Modality, (2) Forensic Goal & Task, (3) Evidentiary Features, and (4) Search & Analysis Scope. And the overall four-branch division is logical and intuitive.

* 1 Strongly Disagree, 2 Disagree, 3 Neutral, 4 Agree, 5 Strongly Agree  
* Please explain your rating.

2.2. Please provide any general comments on this high-level structure. For example, do you believe a major branch is missing or that two branches should be combined?

### **Section 3: Detailed Branch Evaluation**

*This is the core section of the survey. For each of the four main branches, we will ask a set of questions regarding its organization, completeness, correctness, and clarity. A link to the interactive viewer for browsing the complete ontology will be provided on each page.*

**Page 6**

**Branch 1: Modality**

*Link to the interactive viewer: \[Link\]*   
*You can browse the ontology in three different ways: 1\. Expandable Tree, 2\. Graph, and 3\. Sunburst Chart.*

3.1.1. **Organization**: The structure and grouping of nodes within the Target Modality branch is logical and effective.

(Example: Should there be a “multimodal” node in this branch?)

* 1 Strongly Disagree, 2 Disagree, 3 Neutral, 4 Agree, 5 Strongly Agree  
* Please explain your rating.

3.1.2. **Completeness**: Are there any significant media types or modalities missing from this branch?

(Example: Should “3D/Spatial Media” be added as a distinct modality to reflect emerging technologies like AR/VR)

* Yes / No / Unsure  
* If you select Yes, please explain what is missing and why.

3.1.3. **Correctness**: Is anything in this branch misplaced? Does any node belong in a different branch entirely?

(Example: As supportive modalities for visual media analysis, should “text” and “audio” be standalone modalites in this branch?)

* Yes / No / Unsure  
* If you select Yes, please explain what is misplaced and why.

3.1.4. **Naming & Clarity**: Are any of the node names within this branch ambiguous, incorrect, or confusing?

(Example: Does the label “Video” clearly convey its intended scope? Would “Moving Image” be more precise to avoid conflating it with associated audio content?)

* Yes / No / Unsure  
* If you select Yes, please explain what is unclear and why.

3.1.5. **Additional Comments**: If there’s anything about this branch you’d like to comment on that wasn’t addressed in the previous questions, please use the text box below.

**Branch 2: Forensic Goal & Task**

*Link to the interactive viewer: \[Link\]*   
*You can browse the ontology in three different ways: 1\. Expandable Tree, 2\. Graph, and 3\. Sunburst Chart.*

3.2.1. **Organization**: The structure and grouping of nodes within the Forensic Goal & Task branch is logical and effective.

(Example: Should modality be considered as a factor when organizing this branch? For example, splitting “Forgery & Manipulation Detection” based on if the media is a video or an image.)

* 1 Strongly Disagree, 2 Disagree, 3 Neutral, 4 Agree, 5 Strongly Agree  
* Please explain your rating.

3.2.2. **Completeness**: Are there any significant manipulation techniques or forensic tasks for digital visual media missing from this branch?

(Example: Any “Signal-level Post-processing” other than “Compression” is missing? “Cheapfake” should be added to this branch somewhere?)

* Yes / No / Unsure  
* If you select Yes, please explain what is missing and why.

3.2.3. **Correctness**: Is anything in this branch misplaced? Does any node belong in a different branch?

(Example:  Does it make sense to place “Steganography” under “Forgery & Manipulation Detection”?)

* Yes / No / Unsure  
* If you select Yes, please explain what is misplaced and why.

3.2.4. **Naming & Clarity**: Are any of the node names within this branch ambiguous, incorrect, or confusing?

* Please explain your rating.

3.3.2. **Completeness**: Are there any significant feature families or specific forensic cues for digital visual media missing from this branch?

* Yes / No / Unsure  
* If you select Yes, please explain what is missing and why.

3.3.3. **Correctness**: Is anything in this branch misplaced? Does any node belong in a different branch?

(Example: Should “Compression Artifacts” be a standalone node under “Hand-crafted Features”? Should “MFCC” be placed under “Frequency Domain Features” or “Temporal Domain Features”?)

* Yes / No / Unsure  
* If you select Yes, please explain what is misplaced and why.

3.3.4. **Naming & Clarity**: Are any of the node names within this branch ambiguous, incorrect, or confusing?

(Example: Should “Deep Features” be changed to “Deep Learning Features”? Does “High-level Semantic Features” vs “Low-level Signal Features” sound clearer?)

* Please explain your rating.

3.4.2. **Completeness**: Are there any particular analysis scopes for digital visual media missing from this branch?

(Example: Should we consider “Captions”, “Transcripts”, and so on from supportive modalities (Text & Audio) here in this branch? Patch/Block is not included in the current branch, should it be added back under “Spatial Granularity”?)

* Yes / No / Unsure  
* If you select Yes, please explain what is missing and why.

3.4.3. **Correctness**: Is anything in this branch misplaced? Does any node belong in a different branch?

(Example: Should “Full Face” be a standalone node as a “ROI”?)

* Yes / No / Unsure  
* If you select Yes, please explain what you believe is misplaced and why.

3.4.4. **Naming & Clarity**: Are any of the node names within this branch ambiguous, incorrect, or confusing?
