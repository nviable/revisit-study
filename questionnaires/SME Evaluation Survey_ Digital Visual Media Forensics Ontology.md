## **SME Evaluation Survey: Digital Visual Media Forensics Ontology**

### **Page 1**

### **Introduction**

Thank you for lending your expertise to evaluate this Digital Visual Media Forensics (DVM-F) ontology. This ontology aims to create a standardized, hierarchical structure of terminologies used across the DVM-F field, based on an analysis of academic literature and guidance from standardization bodies. The ontology consists of four branches capturing the analytics’ targeted modalities, the type of manipulations analytics detect or tasks they complete, the features used by the analytics, and the analysis scope. Your feedback is invaluable for refining its structure, ensuring its completeness and correctness, and assessing its potential utility for researchers, practitioners, and analysts.

**Instructions:** The survey has **five sections**, starting from gathering some basic demographic information about your expertise, and moving into assessing the completeness and correctness of the proposed ontology from high-level to detailed branch-by-branch view. Please have the interactive ontology viewer open for reference as you proceed. And, the survey will wrap up with an evaluation on how to view the ontology and its application potential. The survey should take approximately 25-35 minutes.

Please proceed to the next page to view and complete the **Informed Consent Document** for this study.

### **Section 2: Overall Ontological Structure**

*This question assesses your high-level impression of the ontology's core framework. Please open the interactive viewer to browse the complete ontology.*   
*Link to the interactive viewer: \[Link\]*   
*You can browse the ontology in three different ways: 1\. Expandable Tree, 2\. Graph, and 3\. Sunburst Chart.*

2.1. The ontology is divided into four main branches: (1) Target Modality, (2) Manipulation / Task, (3) Feature / Cue, and (4) Search / Analysis Scope. On a scale of 1 to 5, how logical and intuitive do you find this overall four-branch division?

* 1 Very illogical, 2 Illogical, 3 Neutral, 4 Logical, 5 Very Logical

2.2. Please provide any general comments on this high-level structure. For example, do you believe a major branch is missing or that two branches should be combined?

### **Section 3: Detailed Branch Evaluation**

*This is the core section of the survey. For each of the four main branches, we will ask a consistent set of questions regarding its organization, completeness, correctness, and clarity. Link to the interactive viewer for browsing the complete ontology will be provided on every page in this section.*

**Branch 1: Modality**

*Link to the interactive viewer: \[Link\]*   
*You can browse the ontology in three different ways: 1\. Expandable Tree, 2\. Graph, and 3\. Sunburst Chart.*

3.1.1. **Organization**: How logical is the internal structure and grouping of nodes within this branch?

(Example: Does it make sense for “Multimodal” to be a top-level modality?)

* 1 Very Illogical, 2 Illogical, 3 Neutral, 4 Logical, 5 Very Logical  
* If you select 1 or 2, please explain the reason in the text box below.

3.1.2. **Completeness**: Are there any significant media types or modalities missing from this branch?

(Example: Should “Audio” be included as a top-level modality?)

* Yes / No  
* If you select No, please explain the reason in the text box below.

3.1.3. **Correctness**: Is anything in this branch misplaced? Does any node belong in a different branch entirely?

(Example: “Deepfake Video” was previously listed under “Video” but was moved to the Manipulation/Task branch because it describes a manipulation type, not a modality. Do you see any other similar issues?)

* Yes / No  
* If you select No, please explain the reason in the text box below.

3.1.4. **Naming & Clarity**: Are any of the node names within this branch ambiguous, incorrect, or confusing?

(Example: Is the term “Still Image” clear, or should it just be “Image”? Is “Text-only” too confusing?)

* 1 Very Unclear, 2 Unclear, 3 Neutral, 4 Clear, 5 Very Clear  
* If you select 1 or 2, please explain the reason in the text box below.

3.1.5. **Additional Comments**: If there’s anything about this branch you’d like to comment on that wasn’t addressed in the previous questions, please use the text box below.

* If you select 1 or 2, please explain the reason in the text box below.

3.2.2. **Completeness**: Are there any significant manipulation techniques or forensic tasks for visual media missing from this branch?

(Example: Should 'Steganography Detection' have its own node? Is the concept of an 'Anomaly Detection' task missing?)

* Yes / No  
* If you select No, please explain the reason in the text box below.

3.2.3. **Correctness**: Is anything in this branch misplaced? Does any node belong in a different branch?

(Example: Does 'Re-encoding & Recompression History Analysis' feel more like a 'Feature / Cue' than a 'Task'? Why or why not?)

* Yes / No  
* If you select No, please explain the reason in the text box below.

3.2.4. **Naming & Clarity**: Are any of the node names within this branch ambiguous, incorrect, or confusing?
