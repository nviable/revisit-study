/**
 * Authored study content for the STOP&SCAN expert panel.
 *
 * v4 changes from v3-pilot:
 *  - Two-level outcome model: an EVIDENCE STATE produced by the framework
 *    (confirmed / contradicted / unresolved), plus an ACTION selected by the
 *    ENCOUNTER TYPE (information / request / alert).
 *  - Runs are told from the point of view of a named fictional observer.
 *    Each step carries the character's thought, the actions they took, and a
 *    neutral narrator note. Real public figures keep their real names; the
 *    observer is invented in every case.
 *  - STOP is folded into step 1 alongside Source (four pages, five elements).
 *  - Every case is frozen to a stated date. Some have since developed further;
 *    this is disclosed once in orientation and again at debrief.
 *  - Presentation order is case2 -> case3 -> case4 -> case1. Component ids are
 *    unchanged so analysis scripts and the IRB packet still resolve.
